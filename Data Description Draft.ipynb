    "# Motivation<br>\n",
    "BaseballSavant is a site dedicated to providing player matchups, Statcast metrics, and advanced statistics in a simple and easy-to-view way. Daren Willman created the website as an employee of MLB. MLB funded the creation of this data set.<br><br>\n",
    "#Composition<br><br>\n",
    "The only instance of the data is statistics of years of play by professional baseball players in MLB, of which there are 708 instances (of that one type) in this dataset. This dataset is a subset of a larger set. The larger set is all available statistics from BaseballSavant for every MLB player during the timespan 2015-2020. The sample is representative of the larger set, as we set a minimum threshold for Plate Appearances (MLB qualifies players for awards at 502 Plate Appearances), so we only exclude player years that had relatively small sample sizes in terms of Plate Appearences. The data in each instance consists of Statcast statistics, normal batting statistics, name, and year. Important statistics are detailed below in the table. There are no labels or targets associated with each instance. There is no missing information in the dataset. There is one instance of relationships between individual instances, in the column that shows which team the player belongs to. You can determine which players are on the same team from this column. This relationship is not made explicit. There are no recommended data splits. There are no errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset. The dataset relies on game files from MLB Advanced Media, L.P. There are no guarantees, but it would be highly unlikely for MLB to cease producing public game files. There are no restrictions associated with any of the external resources. The link provided by baseballsavant to external resources is http://mlb.mlb.com/. This link does not lead to any datasets, the link is to the MLB website’s home page. I could not find the individual game files with the raw data used by MLB to create the dataset we are using. The dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential. The dataset does not contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety. The data relates to people, and the data is observations of performance by the professional athletes to whom it relates. The dataset does not specify any subpopulations. It is possible to identify individuals as their names are included in the data set. The dataset does not contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way.<br><br>\n",
    "# Collection Process<br>\n",
    "MLB does not say how they collect visually observable game data, but a possible way it could be done is by the game record of the official scorer, who decides some subjective elements of the game record (such as Errors). Some of the data was directly observable, some of the data was collected using Statcast. Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking technology, capable of measuring previously unquantifiable aspects of the game. Set up in all 30 Major League ballparks, Statcast collects data using a series of high-resolution optical cameras along with radar equipment. The technology precisely tracks the location and movements of the ball and every player on the field, resulting in an unparalleled amount of information covering everything from the pitcher to the batter to baserunners and defensive players. These mechanisms are validated through a process called “MLB Ground Truth Testing”, a collaboration with WSU’s Sports Science Lab (further reading: https://technology.mlblogs.com/mlb-ground-truth-testing-ec87c73450b9). The dataset that we chose, which is a subset of all Statcast statistics from 2015-2020 was chosen to only include Statcast statistics relating to offensive performance, including batting statistics and player speed statistics. Data collection was performed by paid employees of MLB. Data is collected in real time as games are played, over the span that our data was chosen. This timeframe matches the creation timeframe of the data. There were no ethical review processes conducted. The dataset does relate to people, as stated before. The data was not collected from the individuals in question directly; their performances as athletes were observed both visually and mechanically. I could not find evidence that individuals were notified that their performance data was being collected, but they were aware of that fact. I could not find evidence that the individuals in question consented to the collection and use of their data, but due to the specific nature of these individuals being athletes and this data not being personal information, but rather their athletic performance, consent in this fashion does not apply. There has been no analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects conducted.<br><br>\n",
    "# Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling<br>\n",
    "There was no preprocessing done to the data in this dataset.<br><br>\n",
    "# Uses<br>\n",
    "This dataset has been used before, mostly in the area of articles written about these statistics or the use of these statistics as tidbits by sports commentators during games. There is no one repository, but sabr.org is a resource with many baseball research papers, some of which use Statcast data. One example of a paper is found at this link: https://lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/ir/handle/10365/28371. This dataset could also be used to determine how to develop and improve a specific player by looking at underlying weaknesses, or how to value a player in the Free Agent market based on projected performance. There is nothing about the composition of this dataset that might impact future uses. I do not believe that there are any tasks for which the dataset should not be used, that are inside the realm of baseball research.<br><br><br>\n",
