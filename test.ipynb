    "1. More In-Depth Analysis of Launch Angle:\n",
    "In our exploratory data analysis, we noticed that launch angle average did not have a high correlation coefficient with offensive value stats such as OPS+ and wRC+. We think this is because there is an ideal numerical range of average launch angles, and values above and below this range are not as good offensively. We plan to look through the launch angle average data, make a histogram of the data, and then assign different ranges of average launch angles to a new categorical predictor, using the map() function. Then we will perform a linear regression of this new categorical predictor on our offensive value stats, hoping to identify ranges of launch angles which have significant relationships with the offensive value stats."

    "2. More In-Depth Analysis of Sprint Speed/UBR: In our exploratory data analyses we noticed that there was a negative association between batters with higher sprint speeds and their offensive stats. Therefore, want to dig into why this relationship occurs and possibly narrow down some significant statistics that are more strongly associated with sprint speed. In addition to the analyses on UBR, which is a base running statistic, we want to perform further anlyses on this statistic in relation to other offensive stats, including but not limited to, OBP, Slugging %, ISO power and EXO BP. This would be done in order to see which offensive stats have the strongest relationship to UBR.  "
