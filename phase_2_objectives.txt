Data Cleaning: Jonas
Monday-----> Have UBR and wRC+ stats of individual players for 2019 season
and ensure all data has significant values(No NaN entries etc.) Have each of the csv Dataframes narrowed to the column that pertains to the specific stat and append the columns to the statcast dataframe

Geoff:
Data description. Have an initial draft of your data description section. Your data description should be about your analysis-ready data.

    A general description of the data, including where we got it from, the form that it takes.
    A key that describes each individual column of data that we have so it can be read easily.

Data limitations. Identify any potential problems with your dataset.

    We will find limitations as we go, but right now our dataset seems pretty comprehensive.

Questions for reviewers. List specific questions for your peer reviewers and project mentor to answer in giving you feedback on this phase.

    Everyone should at any point write down questions they have (in this section designated Questions in the readme), I will compile them for the reviewers, as well as any other questions I can think of.

Questions:

I will have the Data description done by Wednesday morning Oct. 7, and I will work on questions and limitations as we find them.

Brendan:
- Summary statistics for predictor variables
- Correlation coefficients and scatter plots between interesting pairs of variables
- Possibly do some correlation coefficients between predictor variables to avoid having multiple redundant variables in our final analysis
- Will take about two days to do this analysis
